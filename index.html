                    <h3>Cooking</h3>
                    <p> I've always been intrested in cooking ever since I was little. One of my favorite dishes to cook is mapo tofu because of how modular the dish is. For example, the most commonly type of meat used in mapo tofu is ground pork; however, this can easily be replaced with any meat of your choice. Meals cooked at home with fresh ingredients will always taste better and cost less than meals at restaurants.</p>

                    <h3>Badminton</h3>
                    <p>Badminton is a sport that I've grown to like over time. Initially it felt like I was just hitting the birdie randomly and prayed that it would go over. But as I learned the game more and more, I realized just how technical everything about the sport was. I like playing badminton becasue of the constant fast paced back and forth rallies that don't happen in any other sport. </p>

                    <h3>Video games</h3>
                    <p>For me, video games are a great way for me to relax and escape from reality and my responsibility. I really enjoy playing multiplayer games like league of lengeds, valorant and mminecraft with my friends. Of course, I also enjoy playing a good story based single player game from time to time. Some of my favorites include: Little Nightmares, Omori and Sekiro just to name a few. </p>
